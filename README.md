# RG_UnrestrictedHScene

Illusion has added a number of positions in the expansion disc RG Paradise but as a usual practice they has not added them in the maps of the original installment which hugely limited the usage.<br>
This mod is trying to fix this issue for the lazy Illusion.<br>

Players can now create situations like sex toy demo presentation in the office, tentacles treatment in clinics, SM show in the casino stage, walk the dog in the park, etc.<br>
This should make the game a little bit more "usable".

## Features

- Unlock the map limitation setting for all positions that added in expansion.
- Add 4P points to every map.
- Add stairs points to NEET's home and Restaurant

## Installation
1. Download the plugin from [Releases](https://github.com/hawkeye-e/RG_UnrestrictedHScene/releases)
2. Extract the zip file and copy to the "BepInEx\plugins" folder in your RG installation directory

## Note:
Room Girl Paradise expansion is required.
